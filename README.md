## 1. Introduction

  

This document outlines the architecture and implementation details of our on-demand logistics platform. The platform is built using Next.js, Supabase, Google Maps API for routing and distance estimation, and Real-Time Service with Nodejs socket server with redis for in memory database.

Our system architecture consists of the following key components:

  

- *Frontend*: Next.js application

- *Backend*: Supabase

- *Authentication*: OAuth via Supabase

- *Database*: Supabase PostgreSQL

- *Real-time Communication*: Socket.io with Redis

- *External Services*: Google Maps API

There are three sequences of operations before a trip starts, as shown in the image above: i) Update Driver Location ii) List nearby drivers iii) Requesting for a ride. The first sequence of operations involves updating the driver locations as drivers keep changing their locations. The second sequence comprises of the steps involved in fetching the list of nearby drivers. The third sequence includes a series of steps involved in requesting and dispatching a ride.

## 3. Key Features

  

- User registration and authentication (OAuth)

- Booking service with upfront price estimation

- Real-time vehicle tracking

- Driver job assignment and status updates

- Admin dashboard for fleet management and analytics

  

## 4. Scalability and Performance

  

To handle 10,000 requests per second and support 50 million users and 100,000 drivers, we've implemented the following scalability measures:

  

### Load Balancing

- Utilize Supabase's built-in load balancing capabilities

- Implemented application-level load balancing using the service Nginx.

  

### Caching

- Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data (e.g.,Latitude and Longitude, user profiles, vehicle information)

- Use Next.js built-in caching mechanisms for static and server-side rendered pages

  

### Database Optimization

- Leverage Supabase's PostgreSQL database with proper indexing and query optimization

- Implement database sharding for user and booking data based on geographical regions (Geosharding)

  

### Microservices Architecture

- For now we are using only socket as a microservice but in the future we can also have microservice for maps to enhance our system.

  

## 5. Database Design

Key entities in our database schema:

- Users

- Drivers

- Vehicles

- Bookings

- Tracking Data

- Payments

  

## 6. Real-Time Data Handling

  

To manage real-time GPS tracking for thousands of concurrent users:


- Use Socket.io for real-time communication between drivers and users

- Implement a pub/sub system using Redis to broadcast location updates

- Optimize location update frequency (e.g., update every 5-10 seconds instead of continuously)

- Use geohashing techniques to efficiently query nearby drivers

  

## 7. Matching Algorithm

  

Our matching algorithm efficiently assigns drivers to users based on:

- Proximity (using geospatial indexing)

- Vehicle type (Tempo or Semi-Truck here)

- Driver availability(Accept & Decline)

To handle thousands of concurrent users and drivers:

- Implement a distributed queue system (e.g., Apache Kafka) to process matching requests

- Use in-memory data structures (e.g., Redis) to store driver availability and location data

- Implement batching to process multiple matching requests simultaneously

  

## 8. Pricing Model

  

Our dynamic pricing model considers:

- Distance (calculated using Google Maps API)
- The Capacity of the Transport system
- The other costs like maintenance and fuel prices
- All of these included we have a price per kilometer calculated which can be changed automatically as it is broken into components like base fare and variable fare thus future proofing it .

  

Surge pricing is implemented by:

- Monitoring real-time demand in specific areas

- Applying dynamic multipliers to base fares during high-demand periods

- Using a distributed cache (e.g., Redis) to store and update pricing factors in real-time
- Future scope we can deploy prediction models to do this work and get good results 

  

## 9. Security and Authentication

  

- OAuth implementation via Supabase ensures secure user authentication

- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for users, drivers, and admins

- Use HTTPS for all communications

- Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse

  

## 10. Areas for Improvement

  

1. *Scheduled Bookings*: Implement a feature for users to schedule future bookings

- Use a job scheduler (e.g., Bull with Redis) to manage future bookings

- Implement a notification system to remind users and drivers of upcoming bookings

  

2. *Advanced Analytics*:

- Implement a data warehouse solution (e.g., Amazon Redshift) for complex analytics

- Use machine learning models to predict demand and optimize driver allocation

  

3. *Multi-region Support*:

- Implement a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for static assets

- Use multi-region database replication for improved global performance

  

4. *Offline Support*:

- Implement Progressive Web App (PWA) features for offline functionality

- Use background sync to handle offline booking requests

  

5. *Enhanced Real-time Features*:

- Implement WebRTC for direct communication between dr…

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
